<div style="text-align:center"><span style="color:orange"><strong>Coins from the Bitcoin Signet network are intentionally worthless.</strong></span></div>

<br/>

Bitcoin Signet is a test Bitcoin network, used for testing and educational purposes. This is a feature of Bitcoin, not a bug.

If you're being offered "Free" or "Discount" bitcoin and promised they are real bitcoin, they may be worthless Bitcoin Signet coins.
You may be cheated for your time and/or money. Be wary.

The remainder of this page will provide some basic guidelines and links to more information.

<br/>
## Basic Guidelines

All of the below numbered steps are necessary, none are optional.

```
Symbol Legend

‚úÖ  This is a necessary check for your safety.
üö©  This is a red flag. It should not occur.
‚ö†Ô∏è  This is a caveat or precautionary statement.
```
<br/>
### 1. Always decide and download your Bitcoin Wallet for yourself

Bitcoin wallets can be repackaged to work with Bitcoin Signet. This is a feature not a bug.

Such wallets may behave similar to wallets with real bitcoin.

Always know which wallet you are using and why.

‚úÖ Determined the wallet's official URL using a search engine like Google, Bing, DuckDuckGo.

‚úÖ Downloaded the wallet from its official URL or App stores like the Android and IOS App store.

‚úÖ The wallet is open source and a publicly visible project with activity on [Github](https://github.com) or [Gitlab](https://gitlab.com).

‚úÖ Confirmed that the Website or App is published and owned by the original authors and developers.

‚úÖ Confirmed that the software version matches that of a recent stable release, and signed by the authors and developers.

üö© Obtained a URL or app to a wallet software from someone else.

üö© Downloaded or using a wallet that someone else provides to you.

üö© The wallet is not an open source project.

üö© The open source project is recent with little or no activity

‚ö†Ô∏è This is not sufficient since your network can be compromised and the above checks can be faked. Follow up with step 2 and step 3 described below.

<br/>
### 2. Check the address format

Learn what real bitcoin addresses look like.

When sending bitcoin or receiving them yourself, the bitcoin address will begin with a valid prefix. If you are sending or receiving to an address without this prefix, then 
you are not dealing with actual bitcoin.

‚úÖ The bitcoin address can be viewed.

‚úÖ The wallet lets you generate many different addresses that look different.

‚úÖ All addresses start with ```1``` or ```2``` or ```bc1```.

üö© You cannot see the bitcoin address on your wallet.

‚ö†Ô∏è This is not sufficient since a compromised wallet can show you legit addresses but do something else in the background. Proceed to step 3 described below.

<br/>
### 3. Test a small transaction and verify it on a well known Explorer

Always run a test transaction with an insignificant amount. Wait for a minimum of 2 confirmations before proceeding to the intended & final transaction.

‚úÖ A small insignificant transaction was successfully confirmed on the Mainnet on more than 1 block explorer. Here's a few you can use: 
[Mempool](https://mempool.space/), [Blockstream](https://blockstream.info/), [Bitcoin Explorer](https://bitcoinexplorer.org/), [BlockCypher](https://live.blockcypher.com/btc/)

‚úÖ The next transaction with the intended amount has the exact same workflow as the test transaction and there are no changes needed.

üö© You are asked to confirm the transaction on an unknown/lesser-known block explorer.

üö© You are asked to confirm the transaction by selecting the Signet or Testnet network.

üö© You are asked to restart the wallet software or regenerate a new wallet or create a new address to perform the intended & final transaction.

‚ö†Ô∏è If any of the above red flags occur, stop and do not perform the intended & final transaction
